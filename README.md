# Event Log Enrichment

This project contains a Python notebook designed to check and enrich a healthcare event log by merging data from CSV and XLS/XLSX files.  
The main goal is to add end-of-report information (`TIMESTAMP_END`) and other relevant columns, ensuring consistency between datasets and saving the enriched results.

## Main Features

- Load an event log from a CSV file and additional data from an Excel file (XLS/XLSX)
- Check consistency between cases in both files (row count per case_id)
- Enrich the log with additional columns (`DAY_start`, `DAY_end`, `ESI_x_concurrent`, `SHIFT`)
- Exclude and track case_ids with inconsistencies between the two files
- Export results and control logs in CSV format

## Folder Structure

- **data_in/**  
  Contains input files:  
  <!-- - `EVENT-LOG_ED_ENG.csv`: main event log  -->
  <!-- - `Estrazione_Step_PS_ConSchedaCriptato.xls` or `.xlsx`: additional data  -->
  <!-- - `.json` files for column data type definitions -->

- **data_out/**  
  Contains all output files generated by the notebook:  
  <!-- - Base event log (`*_base.csv`) -->
  <!-- - Enriched event log (`*_enriched.csv`) -->
  <!-- - List of skipped case_ids -->
  <!-- - Reports on differences between files -->

- **01_check_and_enrich.ipynb**  
  The main notebook that performs all checking and enrichment operations.

- **functions.py**  
  Utility functions used by the notebook (e.g. JSON loading, directory creation).

## Requirements

See the `requirements.txt` file for the necessary Python packages (notably: `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `xlrd`).

## Usage

1. Place your input files in the `data_in/` folder.
2. Open and run the `01_check_and_enrich.ipynb` notebook.
3. Find the results in the `data_out/` folder.
